HDTimeManager
===================
Makes sure that you don't spend too much time playing Hearthstone, using Hearthstone Deck Tracker's technology.
# What exactly does this do?
You can create custom "time constraints" with it, which, whenever you have reached the certain limit for that day, will flash up a message reminding you that it might be time for you to get off Hearthstone and do something productive instead.
# Cool. How can I use this?
Wherever you have Hearthstone Deck Tracker installed, drop the `HDTimeManager.dll` (available in the releases folder) into the 'Plugins' folder. Then run Hearthstone Deck Tracker and enable this plugin in the plugins menu, and ta-da! *If the plugin does not show up in that list, right click the '[PLUGINNAME].dll', go into Properties and click "Unblock" at the bottom.*
